In a very swift change of tone, he started critizing the current status of the Rheinparlament. Furthermore, he went on about how he thinks most members of the current party in power are corrupt and in the pockets of foreign powers. \n  The congress abruptly became filled with shouts of disapproval and discontent. \nBefore leaving the stand, the Rheinmarshal quickly addressed the Belgian Issue in little detail. He simply called for the military to intervene."

Many RNDC members snickered at Adenauer, but many sat there in silence looking at whats unfolding. Adenauer knew that his addressment would be a risky one, but it was one he had to take in order to try and sway some members into the RCC. \n  After a few minutes of addressing various smaller issues, he brought up the issue of Belgium. He proposed that Belgium be granted autonomy, but not full independence. He stated they were not yet ready to be independent. The Congress adjourned shortly after. \n  As Adenauer was getting ready to leave, he was approached by around 20 members of the RNDC. They told Adenauer that they would be leaving the RNDC and joining the RCC."
